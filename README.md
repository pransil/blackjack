# Blackjack Game - built using my repo at claude-code-automation-framework

The real point here is not the BlackJack game but that it was built in less than 1 hour by my claude-code-automation-framework without me typing a single line of code. It figured out where to find the rule, how to use React, etc. I just answered questions. Check out the repo if you are interested.

A single-player web-based Blackjack game built with React frontend and Python FastAPI backend. This educational game focuses on pure gameplay mechanics without betting, perfect for learning blackjack strategy.

## üéØ Features

- **Authentic Blackjack Rules**: Standard casino rules implementation
- **Single Player**: Play against the dealer without betting mechanics
- **Game Actions**: Hit, Stand, Double Down (Split capability built-in)
- **Statistics Tracking**: Track wins, losses, pushes, and win rate
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Educational Focus**: Learn proper blackjack strategy without gambling

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd deliverables
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/api.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd deliverables/src/frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The game will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Open** http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. **Start** a new game (automatic on first load)
3. **Make decisions**:
   - **Hit**: Take another card
   - **Stand**: End your turn
   - **Double Down**: Double stake, take one card, then stand
4. **Learn** from your statistics and improve your strategy!
